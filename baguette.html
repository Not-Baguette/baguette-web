            <h1 class="mt-4">Why Baguettes are absolutely amazing</h1>
            <p class="main-content">A baguette is a type of bread that originated in France and is characterized 
                by its long, narrow shape and crispy crust. It is typically made from basic ingredients such as 
                flour, water, yeast, and salt. The dough is mixed, kneaded, and then allowed to rise before being 
                shaped into the iconic elongated form.</p>

            <div> <!-- Div here just incase of necessary changes later-->
                <p class="main-content">The baguette's unique qualities lie in its texture, taste, and versatility. 
                    When properly baked, it develops a thin, golden-brown crust that is delightfully 
                    crisp and crackles when you bite into it. The interior of a well-made baguette is 
                    light, soft, and airy, with an irregular pattern of small holes, known as the crumb. 
                    This texture creates a wonderful contrast with the crust, making each bite a 
                    delightful experience for the senses.</p>
                
                <p class="main-content">One of the baguette's most remarkable features is its simple yet exquisite flavor. 
                    The combination of the bread's lightly salted dough and the distinct taste that 
                    develops during the baking process results in a subtly tangy and slightly sweet profile. 
                    This flavor is often enhanced by a slight note of toasted cereal that arises from the bread's crust.</p>
                
                <p class="main-content">Another aspect that contributes to the baguette's allure is its versatility. 
                    It serves as a staple in French cuisine and can be enjoyed in numerous ways. 
                    It makes a perfect accompaniment to a wide range of dishes, such as cheeses, 
                    cured meats, soups, and salads. It can be sliced and used as the base for sandwiches 
                    or toasted to create crispy crostini. Its lightness and delicate flavor make it an ideal 
                    vehicle for showcasing various toppings and fillings, allowing for endless culinary creativity.</p>
                
                <p class="main-content">Formally speaking, the baguette embodies the essence of French baking tradition 
                    and craftsmanship. Its creation requires skill and attention to detail, as it 
                    relies on the proper balance of ingredients, precise shaping, and precise baking 
                    techniques. Mastering the art of baguette making can take years of practice and dedication.</p>
                
                <p class="main-content">In French culture, the baguette holds a special place. It is an iconic symbol of 
                    everyday life, often seen tucked under the arms of Parisians as they make their 
                    way home from a local boulangerie. The sound of a baguette's crust being torn apart 
                    or the sight of its crumb peeking through a paper bag evokes a sense of comfort, 
                    tradition, and culinary excellence.</p>

            <!-- HOW TO MAKE BAGUETTE -->
            <h2 id="section3">How to make a baguette</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>500 grams (4 cups) bread flour</li>
              <li>10 grams (2 teaspoons) salt</li>
              <li>10 grams (2 teaspoons) sugar</li>
              <li>7 grams (2 ¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
              <li>350 milliliters (1 ½ cups) warm water</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="baguette-image2" width=300 height=500 alt="Baguette Picture failed to load :c" src="https://www.bakedbyanintrovert.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Baguette-7.jpg">
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
              <li>Mix the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour and salt.</li>
              <li>Combine the ingredients: Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the activated yeast mixture. Gradually incorporate the flour into the liquid, mixing with a wooden spoon or your hands until the dough comes together.</li>
              <li>Knead the dough: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment to knead the dough.</li>
              <li>First rise: Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free area for about 1 to 1 ½ hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
              <li>Shape the baguettes: Once the dough has risen, gently punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer it to a lightly floured surface and divide it into three equal portions. Shape each portion into a rectangular shape by flattening the dough and folding it from the top and bottom towards the center. Then roll the dough tightly from one end to the other to form a baguette shape. Repeat with the remaining portions.</li>
              <li>Second rise: Place the shaped baguettes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a baguette pan. Cover them with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 to 45 minutes, or until they have puffed up.</li>
              <li>Preheat the oven: While the baguettes are rising, preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). If you have a baking stone or a baking steel, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
              <li>Score the baguettes: Just before baking, use a sharp knife or a razor blade to make diagonal slashes along the top of each baguette. This helps the bread expand and gives it the classic baguette appearance.</li>
              <li>Bake the baguettes: Transfer the risen baguettes to the preheated oven. If you have a baking stone or a baking steel, carefully slide the baguettes onto it. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the baguettes are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
              <li>Cool and enjoy: Remove the baguettes from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. Allow them to cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and enjoying.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>1. Crispy crust</h3>

            <h3>6. Social aspect</h3>

            <!-- ETIQUETTE SECTION -->
            <h2 id="section6">Proper Etiquette to eat Baguette</h2>
            <img class="baguette-image2" width=500 height=300 src="https://www.travelgluttons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Wordpress-posts-photos-4.jpg">
            <h3>1. Break off a piece</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">Instead of biting directly into the baguette, it is proper etiquette 
                to break off a small piece of the crust with your hands or a bread knife. This allows you to 
                enjoy the baguette in smaller, manageable portions.</p>
          
            <h3>2. Butter sparingly</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">If butter is served with the baguette, it is considered proper 
                etiquette to apply it sparingly to the piece you've broken off. Avoid slathering the entire 
                slice with butter, as it can overpower the flavor of the bread.</p>
          
            <h3>3. Don't overload</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">When making a sandwich or topping the baguette with ingredients, 
                it is important to avoid overloading it. Keep the toppings balanced and restrained to prevent 
                the baguette from becoming too messy or difficult to handle.</p>
          
            <h3>4. Use a bread plate</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">If a bread plate is provided, it is proper etiquette to place your 
                piece of baguette on the plate rather than directly on the tablecloth or table. This helps 
                maintain cleanliness and prevents crumbs from scattering.</p>
          
            <h3>5. Break and eat as you go</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">Instead of attempting to consume the entire length of the baguette
                 all at once, it is more appropriate to break off small pieces as you eat. This allows you to 
                 enjoy the baguette gradually and prevents it from becoming stale or dry.</p>
          
            <h3>6. Avoid double-dipping</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">If you're enjoying the baguette with a dip or spread, it is 
                considered proper etiquette to avoid double-dipping. Take a small amount of the dip onto 
                your plate and use your piece of baguette to scoop it up, preventing the spread from being 
                contaminated.</p>
          
            <h3>7. Chew with your mouth closed</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">When eating baguette, it is important to chew with your mouth closed. 
                This shows respect to those around you and prevents excessive noise or the display of half-chewed 
                food.</p>
          
            <h3>8. Take small bites</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">To ensure ease of eating and prevent crumbs from scattering, it is 
                proper etiquette to take small, manageable bites of the baguette. This allows you to enjoy the 
                bread without making a mess.</p>
          
            <h3>9. Enjoy with other dishes</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">Baguettes are often served as part of a meal. It is recommended to 
                enjoy them alongside other dishes, such as soups, salads, or cheese platters, as they complement 
                and enhance the overall dining experience.</p>
          
            <h3>10. Respect cultural customs</h3>
            <p class="afterthought-content">If you are dining in a different cultural setting, it is important 
                to be aware of and respect the local customs and traditions associated with eating baguettes or 
                bread in general. This ensures that you are mindful of the cultural etiquette and demonstrates 
                your appreciation for the local customs.</p>
